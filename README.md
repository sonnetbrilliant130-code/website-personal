## How It Works 

This project consists of two main pages:
1. A landing page with "Yes" and "No" buttons (`index.html`)
2. A date scheduler page (`yes.html`) that appears after clicking "Yes"

### Features:
- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button cycles through messages, while the "Yes" button grows in size
- **Date Scheduler**: Choose your preferred date and time for the date
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Automatically sends the chosen date via WhatsApp
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
